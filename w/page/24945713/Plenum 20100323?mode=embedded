<li>(Much detail dropped)</li>
<li>She asked Alvin repeatedly about whether various phones worked and whether anyone was using them, Alvin explained that there were no phones available for her to take.</li>
<li>She was stopped later "helping to tidy up" by looking inside the boxes which contain the phones </li>

<li>Raz seconded</li>
<li>PASSED (Ruiwen and Chris abstained, all others supported)</li>
