<li>Electrician visit to provide a quote on 18 Feb 10.</li>
<li>Meng will continue to work on the Internet connection, but Singapore lacks the back-end infrastructure =&gt; months away.</li>
<li>We have more pledges for Makerbot than required. We will place an order within days with some "extra bits".</li>
<li>Justin is working on setting up the door system now. He expects to assign PINs and distribute by the end of February. We will continue to use the shared PIN for the time being.</li>
<li>Noise reduction for gallery.
<p>Roland's suggestion: red gels tied to microphones in the gallery. This would provide immediate feedback that we are creating too much noise below.</p>
<ul>
<li>The floor is thin, and the gallery below has no ceiling.</li>
<li>Separate mics for different locations tied to an location-specific indicators.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We have been asked crash space for attendees of BarCamp 13 Mar 10 (Singapore Polytech). Be accept to be only an option of last resort.</li>
<li>Thomas proposes to loan a Romba and the PC needed to run it.</li>
<li>Neng Glin will ping Ruiwen about notifications/reminders for membership payments.</li>
<li>Shutter key - we are down to the last one. The person receiving a key creates a copy, keeps the copy, and returns the original.</li>
