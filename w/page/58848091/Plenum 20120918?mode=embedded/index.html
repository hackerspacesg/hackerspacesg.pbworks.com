<h1>Plenum 20120918</h1>
<br />
<div id="displaycontent">
<h1>Minutes</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meeting started 8:45p</p>
<p>Present: Luther, Juanita, Roland, Tamas, Michael, Edmond, Loong Jin, Ben (acting secretary)</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px;">Alvin arrives 9:10p</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><em>Old Business</em></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Membership</h2>
<ul><li>Luther reported on initial results of potential member survey. Suggests that reducing the primary membership price to $96 would increase membership.</li>
<li>Roland's perception was that 75% of membership (approx 40 total) were paying $128/mo but Alvin reports that actually about that many are now paying $64/mo.</li>
<li>Decisions on resetting membership tabled pending accurate financial reports that would be needed to model the impact on our finances.</li>
</ul><p style="margin-left:40px;">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Financial Statements</h2>
<ul><li>Not getting done. Directors presently have an aggregate liability of $450 due to late filing fees and growing.</li>
<li>Besides critical non-optional compliance, accurate books and reporting provides additional value to the organization and its ability to grow and improve value to members.</li>
<li>Recommended to budget approximately $400/month to get our financial house in order and get invoicing consistently done to&nbsp;stabilize&nbsp;revenues.</li>
<li>Ben offers to increase his membership dues to $128/month so long as accurate financial reports are provided and maintained to support this effort.</li>
<li>Juanita (Kolibri) is willing to take on this role for budgeted amount if board will appoint them.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Luther will take recommendation forward to the board and alert them of growing liability.</li>
</ul><p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Receipts and Invoices</h2>
<ul><li>Juanita reports that expenses are not being tracked in any manner where they can be reconciled. Therefore we cannot issue receipts to people requesting such until this is corrected.</li>
<li>Expenses (and income) for items such as drinks need to be tracked via a standard petty cash procedure. Once this is maintained accurately receipts can be issued as appropriate.</li>
<li>Question was raised as to whether and, if so, how we can accept donations from members or non-members.&nbsp;</li>
<ul><li>Yes so long as the transaction can be fully tracked with proper documentation and financial controls.</li>
</ul><li>Was agreed that we cannot ex-post-facto issue receipt for last Saturday's blender training.</li>
<li>Roland leaves @ 10:15p</li>
</ul><p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="text-align:left;">Operational Tasks by Luther</span></h2>
<ul><li><span style="text-align:left;">Luther is overcommitted due to his participation in a startup. Other operating officers may be as well.</span></li>
<li><span style="text-align:left;">Will list the tasks he currently undertakes along with typical time spent and elicit volunteers to take these efforts over.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span style="text-align:left;">Will remain as director and continue with tasks he has time for.</span></li>
</ul><p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="text-align:left;">Tax Filing</span></h2>
<ul><li><span style="text-align:left;">Juanita points out that the prior filed financial reports suggest a (desired) fiscal year ending September 30, 2010 but the associated tax return seems to indicate a December 31, 2010 end of fiscal year.</span></li>
<li><span style="text-align:left;">It is unclear what was actually reported to ACRA.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span style="text-align:left;">We need to confirm and correct this&nbsp;discrepancy&nbsp;with ACRA asap.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span style="text-align:left;">Luther will try to find the relevant original Form C in question and produce for confirmation.</span></li>
</ul><p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="text-align:left;"><em>New Business</em></span></h2>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><span style="text-align:left;">Invoicing</span></h2>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul><li>Several companies who have mail delivered to hackerspace have been waiting to be invoice so they can pay.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Some of these companies' mail was thrown out due to sitting around for long time and non-payment.</li>
<li>It isn't clear now who is actually subscribed to the mail delivery service.</li>
<li>Alvin suggests that everyone receiving mail at hackerspace simply be invoiced and those that don't pay will have their mail thrown out after some time limit.</li>
<li>Juanita suggests 90 day limit for all mail and that this be documented as terms and&nbsp;conditions&nbsp;of the service.&nbsp;</li>
</ul><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>10:42p Adjorned</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Pending Business/Actions for Next Plenum</h2>
