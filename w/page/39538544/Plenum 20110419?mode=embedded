<h1>Minutes</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meeting opened: 20:50</p>
<p>Present: Luther, Ruiwen, Roland, (+1?)</p>
<ul><li>(Forgot to discuss next meeting)</li>
<li>Several items raised by Alvin discussed generally but deferred for resolution when Alvin can be present. </li>
<li>Xavier not present. Ruiwen advises Xavier is now having trouble making time to produce financial reports and that this is likely to continue.</li>
<li>(Roland) Contact Xavier re viability of continued reporting and/or for procedure+records to hand over -&gt; call for someone else to do this, on a volunteer basis or paid (is Juanita willing+able?)</li>
<li>Agreement in principle that JFDI can purchase 2-3 cards for door access for short-term issue to JFDI-related visitors to Singapore (visiting programme participants etc.). Juanita to maintain accessible GDoc of who has the cards from time to time.</li>
<li>Ruiwen raised the potential of short-term use of the $64/month tier for overseas-resident/temporary memberships; agreed that this was within reason and that, as usual, this is within Ruiwen's discretion.</li>
<li>Luther proposed a change of cleaner to the person who cleans Kelvin's office; $200/month twice/week vs. current $50/week once/week (4 hour minimum for estimated 2 hours' work). There is some concern that current cleaner may not be up to scratch and/or not turning up reliably.</li>
