<h1>Increase Number of Members who Renew</h1>
<br />
<div id="displaycontent">
<ul><li>For March 2010, we were short ~$1700 of ~$5700 in budgeted subscription renewals</li>
<li>On April 20 we held a plenum to examine the list of non-payers and plan direct approaches to the members in question</li>
<li>Roland, Luther, Ruiwen and Isaac were tasked with contacting the members in question</li>
</ul><p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul><li>One early piece of feedback from the JFDI and Neoteny guys is that formal, timely invoicing would help. </li>
