<h1>Noise Reduction for Gallery</h1>
<br />
<div id="displaycontent">
<ul>
<li>The floor provides almost no noise damping (floorboards on rafters, no ceiling below, no underfelt under the carpet).</li>
<li>Gallery owner is upset at the amount of noise we're making (walking around) during his business hours.</li>
<li>Underfelting is likely to be prohibitively expensive.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Roland is working on noise-triggered strobes with red gels to operate during the gallery's operating hours. The idea is that rapid feedback will:
<ul>
<li>help those members who want to co-operate but are unthinking making noise to quickly adjust</li>
<li>alert those members/guests who aren't even aware of the problem that there is a problem (mostly by asking others "what's that?")</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>and that helping members co-operate will get the noise down sufficiently.</p>
