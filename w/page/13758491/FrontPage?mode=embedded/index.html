<h2><strong>What's a Hackerspace?</strong></h2>
<p>Well, us geeks need some place to call our own. To hang out, geek out, or to just chill out. To hack on whatever strikes our fancy, without worry that the Starbucks/McDonald's/coffeeshop employee is going to start giving us dirty looks after noticing our last cup of coffee was bought 6 hours ago. It's somewhere to call ~ (or, $HOME, if that's how you roll).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What's NOT a Hackerspace?</h2>
<p>A hackerspace is not a place to do anything illegal from the premises. A hackerspace is not a food and beverage operation. A hackerspace is not an incubation center.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>That's a Hackerspace.</strong></h2>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<p>With a Hackerspace, you're never too far from a fellow Hacker. Fellow Hackers are useful for: 1) chasing down bugs. 2) bouncing ideas (and rubber balls) off. 3) fetching more caffeine. Better yet, if you're a technical project looking for a team, where better place to go than where all the other like-minded, geeky people are?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why do we need a Hackerspace?</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because us geeks are humans, before Hackers. While working on achieving that perfect LCD (or CRT) tan might be the hottest thing this summer, the keyboard and mice really aren't that cool to hang around with 24/7. They don't talk back, they don't review your code, and they can't catch the latest episode of <a href="http://the-big-bang-theory.com/"><em>The Big Bang Theory</em></a> with you. Contact with other Humans in meatspace is pretty rewarding as well (see: <em>Fellow Hackers are useful for:</em>, above). Besides, the only way you're going to Level Up that Geek Cred is by hanging around others like you. Ever played the Game of Life? Stay lonely and die, my friend.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Hackerspace is a place where geeks are free to hack on and experiment with whatever they want. Even if it ends up being <a href="http://www.geekologie.com/2009/05/ive_seen_it_all_now_a_twitteri.php">completely pointless</a>. Hackerspace.sg is the focus of geek activity, and the heart of the Singaporean Geek Culture. Funds accummulated in the running of the Hackerspace could well be channeled back into the community by acquiring further <a href="http://thinkgeek.com"><span style="text-decoration:line-through;">toys</span></a> equipment to share and hack on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>70A Bussorah Street</p>
<p>It's a 5mins walk from Bugis MRT</p>
