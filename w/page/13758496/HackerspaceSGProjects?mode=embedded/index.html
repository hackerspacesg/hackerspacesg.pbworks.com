<h2>Ultimate Todo Recorder in a Keychain</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Summary:</h3>
<p>A simple todo list recorder where entries can be keyed in via different media.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eg. Record voice entries straight to keychain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Text entries in client browser on PC, laptops, smartphones <strong>thru a server app that resides in keychain.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Build list:</h3>
<p>1 x USB keychain that can blast WIFI and act as local server</p>
<p>1 x Server app that resides in the USB&nbsp;keychain</p>
<p>1 x Mic +&nbsp;voice recorder in USB&nbsp;keychain for voice entries</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Binary Clock</h2>
<p>6 columns of LEDs on the clockface, telling time in binary format.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Twitter Ticker</strong></h2>
<p>Hang a small <a href="http://www.superdroidrobots.com/shop/item.asp?itemid=163">LCD&nbsp;display</a> that flash our latest twitter/FB status message. We can also send messages to it thr our IM.</p>

<h2>Real-time Crowd Sensor (RTCS?)</h2>
<p>Motion, IR... Idk yet, but something that can plot the number of people present in the space and send it online to a visualisation so members can see how 'crowded' the space is.</p>
<p>(Thought:&nbsp; If we implement the bluetooth access system mentioned in the project above, it also would provide a rough idea of number of people (those who have BT enabled.&nbsp; It also could indicate number of people present who are not members (again if they have BT enabled but not paired).)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>cat &lt;&lt; RTCS-PROTO</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>&gt;&nbsp;</strong>IR == Too simple; we don't just want numbers; not fun enough =p</p>
<p><strong>&gt;</strong>&nbsp;Motion == Looks like the way to go</p>

<p><strong>&gt;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Software</p>
<p><strong>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>OpenCV/Openframeworks (or some other lib/low-level stuff)</p>
<p><strong>&gt;</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Store incoming real-time data</p>
<p><strong>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Generate graphical representation</p>
<p><strong>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Problems</p>
<p><strong>&gt;</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consistency/Accuracy</p>
<p><strong>&gt;</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have to ensure tracking is foolproof</p>
<p><strong>&gt;</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Long-distance face detection"?</p>

<h2>Pub conference system</h2>
<p>A system to get around the problem of loud pubs and let the people be able to talk to each other. Headsets w mic and everyone can be assigned to some key so u can turn off and on his/her mic...</p>

<h2>Books for needy libraries</h2>
<p>One of the problems facing libraries, especially those in rural areas is that they do not have access to the latest available books. Cory Doctorow recently released his latest work (Makers) as a FREE eBook download and hardcover edition simultaneously. Doctorow also set up an informal, manual system whereby 1) Needy libraries could request a copy of the book and 2) Those who read the eBook edition for free was requested to purchase a copy for one of the listed libraries.</p>
<p>This project wants to extend this idea to allow fractional donations/purchases toward a book, so that e.g. 5 people pitch in as their finances allow to collectively purchase one book for a needy library.&nbsp; - by Stephan M. February</p>

<h2>Resurrect HuddleChat</h2>
<p>A while back a couple of Google engineers engaged in a side project to demonstrate Google AppEngine. The project was called HuddleChat, and was essentially a Campfire (<a href="http://campfirenow.com/">http://campfirenow.com/</a>)&nbsp;clone. 37Signals cried foul, and for some unknown reason the project was taken down. Campfire does not have an API, and 37Signals has no plans to provide one. I'm being forced to use Campfire at work, and it's getting unbearable. This project will resurrect HuddleChat ( I've registered huddlechat.net)&nbsp;and slap a RESTful API on it.&nbsp; - by Stephan M.&nbsp;February</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 130%;"><strong>Singapore Robotics Games 2010</strong></span> - Pole Balancing Robot</p>
<p>RP is hosting robotics games again in 2010. &nbsp;I was looking through the competitions and thinking that the pole-balancing robot might be something we could do quickly and have a reasonable chance of success. &nbsp;The competition is on 26-28 January, so there is not a lot of time.&nbsp; Here's the description/rules--or at least the rules from some time ago.&nbsp; They look similar to those I have that are more current, but there does not seem to be much of a website for this competition:&nbsp; <a href="http://guppy.mpe.nus.edu.sg/srg/srg98/pbr.html">http://guppy.mpe.nus.edu.sg/srg/srg98/pbr.html</a></p>
