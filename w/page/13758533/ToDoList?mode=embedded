<h1>ToDoList</h1>
<br />
<div id="displaycontent">
<p>Create your list category, and when you finish each item, you can either cross out the item by using the "strikethrough" button in the editor's toolbar, or use something like "Assigned to Bob" to designate task status. Or use "HAVE"&nbsp;in front. Whatever works and makes sense.</p>

<h1>Daily necessities</h1>
<ul>
<li>HAVE -&nbsp;Toilet paper BUT this should be replaced all the time; many more rolls are in the pantry cupboard</li>
<li>dishwasher detergent, liquid type</li>
<li>HAVE&nbsp;paper towels</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Dustbins, probably 13 gallon from simplehuman... especially when there are big parties (Boon Lay Stationary also has a good selection, Sven has the full catalog). Currently we can improvise with a chair or the big laundry basket</li>
<li>HAVE&nbsp;Trashbags - need to match the dustbins in size and shape</li>
<li>HAVE&nbsp;cleaning supplies: Floor cleaner, vinegar or baking soda to clean the toilet bowl</li>
<li>vacuum cleaner:&nbsp;Luther can loan his whenever vaccuming is due.</li>
<li>Pails:&nbsp;big and small ones. HAVE&nbsp;big pail. More are welcomed.</li>
<li>HAVE First aid kit. Someone needs to put a note on our local emergency numbers, just in case we have foreign guests. Get more gauze for dressing wounds.</li>
<li>Ice can be bought for $6 a pack from the makan place opposite 7-11. But we should get an ice solution so we can make ice in house. A hacking project perhaps.</li>
<li>
<p>Wine glass racks (requested by Meng). A store in Joo Chiat has these. Price around $10 pr bar, they come in sets of 1, 2, 3 and 4 bars pr modules. See the photos below. Sven can pick up anytime once it's determined how many we need.</p>

<li>

</li>
<li>

<h1>Pantry</h1>
<p>If we are able to provide drinks, baguettes, pizzas and crepes to people during meetups we can generate quite a bit of revenue. Anyway geeks should eat healthy food and not just instant noodles.</p>
<ul>
<li>HAVE&nbsp;an induction cooker and a deep multipurpose frypan to go with it, for warm nuts. Almonds at $12/kg from the nearby wholesale centre</li>
<li>Wholesale prices for drinks are exclusive to F&amp;B/retail businesses, so have to get them from large supermarkets like Sheng Siong (there is one outlet at The Verge). <strike>There is a big discount shop not far, on raceourse road (not Little India), for soft drinks and beer.</strike> (It only accepts cash, and has less variety than Sheng Shiong, and not much cheaper. So we just need someone who drives to round up 1 or 2 helpers to do the shopping at Sheng Shiong.</li>
<li>BoonLay Stationary: 24cans 330ml - 13.00-&gt;16.50/carton depending on type.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Cola most expensive).&nbsp;
<p>24pkts 250ml 11.00/ctn</p>
<p>Boon Lay Stationary has online store and delivery the day after FOC</p>
(Sheng Siong is more pricy)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>Solar panels - get from sponsors or self-hack</li>
<li>Smart-home tech</li>
<li>iPhone 2.0 promise from bleongcw</li>
<li>Get blinds as a projector screen. I think we have been quite happy with the wall so far.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><strong>Furniture</strong></h1>
<ul>
<li>beanbags</li>
<li>banquette for main room</li>
<li>more tables for lab space, long narrow ones would be great to go around the room</li>
<li>lockers:&nbsp;check with members if they really want this.</li>
<li>find out from Objectifs down the road where they got their roller blinds from</li>
<li>Some kind of vertical phamplet holder or mounting for arts/tech groups to put their stuff there?</li>
